# SSH tunnel script
#
# Set the following environment variables:
#
#   SSH_TUNNEL_TARGET=user@hostname:port
#   SSH_TUNNEL_KEY=RSA:{base64 private key}
#   SSH_TUNNEL_FORWARDS=localaddr:localport:remoteaddr:remoteport,[...]
#
# Notes:
#
#   SSH_TUNNEL_KEY is the key type (e.g. "RSA"), a colon character, and then
#   the ssh private key in base64 without the headers/footers or newlines.
#   Yes, you're setting an entire giant ssh key as an environment variable,
#   but it works. :)
#
#   SSH_TUNNEL_FORWARDS is a comma-separated list of args that would normally
#   each be preceded by -L in an ssh command.
#
# In your Procfile, simply run the tunnel before any workers that need it.
#
#   web: python tunnel.py && ....
#
# It's safe to run the script multiple times concurrently. Only one tunnel will
# be made and the other invocations will fail successfully. This way multiple
# workers can depend on the tunnel, and you can still use foreman locally.
